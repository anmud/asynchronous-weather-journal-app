- creating local server (running and producing feedback to the Command Line through a working callback function);
- setting APP API Endpoint;
- setting GET route and POST route, executed on the client side as an asynchronous functions;
- acquiring API credentials from OpenWeatherMap website;
- integrating OpenWeatherMap API: the personal API Key for OpenWeatherMap API is saved in a named  variable, the API Key variable is passed as a parameter to `fetch()`, data is successfully returned from the external API;
